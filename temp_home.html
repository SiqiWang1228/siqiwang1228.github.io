  <p>Thank you for visiting my website!</p>

  <p>My name is Guang-He Lee. I am currently a first-year master's student in the Department of <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw">Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE)</a> at National Taiwan University (NTU) under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen">Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen</a>, but intend to go abroad for Ph.D. study in Fall 2017 if I am fortunate enough to receive an offer of admission. I received my B.S. from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University in June 2015. I have been honored with the <b>NTU Presidential Award</b> every semester between 2011-2015, the <b>Microsoft-IEEE Young Fellowship</b> in 2014, and the <b>Irving T. Ho Memorial Scholarship</b> in 2013 and 2014. I graduated with second-highest marks in my class of 111 students. The Department subsequently nominated me as an <b>Honorary Member of the Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society</b>.</p>

  <p>I have published one conference paper (<a href="pub/LambdaMF_ICDM.pdf">pdf</a>) in the <b><i>Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining</i></b> (ICDM). Due to my outstanding performance when interning at Intel Labs in June-September 2015, Intel filed <b>4 international patent applications</b> on my behalf; we also published a paper (<a href="pub/DMF.pdf">pdf</a>) on arXiv.org for one of our findings. During my junior and senior years of study, I participated in several competitions and fortunately received <b>12th Place</b> at KDD Cup 2014, <b>Excellent Performance Award</b> at TSMC Big Data Competition, the biggest annual data mining competition in Taiwan, in 2014, and 2 <b>First Place</b> and 1 <b>Second Place</b> at the Undergraduate Research Project Exhibition Awards co-organized by NTU CSIE, Appier Inc., and Delta Inc. in 2015.</p>

  <p>
    My research interests include, but not limited to: 
    <ul>
      <li>Representation Learning: Deep Learning, Matrix Factorization</li>
      <li>Natural Language Processing: Word Embedding, Question Answering</li>
    </ul>
    With my solid training and research background, I am also confident in exploring new research areas.
  </p>

  <p>Please kindly send me an e-mail to <a href="mailto:guanghe.lee0304@gmail.com">guanghe.lee0304@gmail.com</a>, should you find my qualifications fit your needs. I will be more than happy to receive your input and reply your mail as soon as possible. Thank you again for visiting my website.</p>
